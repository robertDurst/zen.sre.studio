## Who We Look Up To

One day we aspire to be 1/10th as innovative and successful as the following research labs:

#### Ink and Switch

[Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/): an independent research lab exploring the future of tools for thought.
We envision a new computer that amplifies human intelligence. A system that helps you think more clearly, collaborate more effectively, and is available anywhere and anytime. Though the specifics of our work continue to evolve, everything we do is in pursuit of this vision.

#### Bell Labs

[Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs): Bell Labs and its researchers have been credited with the development of radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, the photovoltaic cell, the charge-coupled device (CCD), information theory, the Unix operating system, and the programming languages B, C, C++, S, SNOBOL, AWK, AMPL, and others, throughout the 20th century.

#### Galois

[Galois](https://www.galois.com/): from building digital engineering tools that make space exploration safer to verifying cryptographic libraries that protect some of the worldâ€™s most valuable data, Galois develops technology to guarantee the trustworthiness of systems where failure is unacceptable.
